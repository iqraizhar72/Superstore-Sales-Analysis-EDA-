# Superstore Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Superstore sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and business insights related to sales, profit, categories, regions, and customer behavior. The analysis is focused on understanding what drives revenue and profit and identifying areas for potential improvement.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand the structure and quality of the dataset
* Analyze sales and profit distribution
* Explore performance across categories, sub-categories, and regions
* Study the impact of discounts on profit
* Identify high-performing and low-performing segments
* Generate visual insights to support business decisions

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Superstore Sales Dataset
* **Source:** Common retail dataset (used for analytics and ML practice)
* **Key Features:**

  * Order Date, Ship Date
  * Category, Sub-Category
  * Region, State
  * Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

* Data loading and inspection (shape, columns, data types)
* Missing value and duplicate checks
* Sales distribution analysis
* Category and sub-category count analysis
* Order and sales comparison by category
* Regional sales and profit analysis
* Profit vs Discount relationship
* Shipping mode analysis
* Top and bottom performing products

## 📊 Key Insights

* Certain categories generate high sales but low profit due to heavy discounts
* Technology category shows strong profitability compared to others
* Some regions consistently underperform and may require strategic review
* High discounts generally correlate with reduced profit

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes multiple visualizations such as:

* Bar charts
* Count plots
* Distribution plots
* Comparative category-wise and region-wise graphs

These help in understanding trends and making data-driven conclusions.
